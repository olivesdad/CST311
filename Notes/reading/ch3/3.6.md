# Principals of congestion control

- denote rate that host is sending data into the socket by $**λin bytes/sec**$
- The rate at which the transport layer sends segments (containing original data and
retransmitted data) into the network will be denoted **$λ′in bytes/sec$**
- if utilizing a link of Capacity R between 2 hosts sending at the same rate to eachtother, throughput will increase as the sending rate **lambda** increass, until the rate reaches $R/2$  when the link is saturated and rate flatlines
- delay increases exponentially as the rate approaches R/2
>When the sending rate exceeds R/2, the averagenumber of queued packets in the router is unbounded, and the average delay between source and destination becomes infinite
- Note on retransmits:
	- llambda in is the data genereated by the application 
	- lambda prime in is what the transport layer puts into the link so if packets are dropped the transport will re-transmit so lambda prime may be hihgher than lambda inn

## Types of Congeston control
- **End-to-end congestion control**. In an end-to-end approach to congestion control, the network layer provides no explicit support to the transport layer for congestion-control purposes. Even the presence of network congestion must be inferred by the end systems based only on observed network behavior (for example, packet loss and delay)
- **Network-assisted congestion control**. With network-assisted congestion control, routers provide explicit feedback to the sender and/or receiver regarding the congestion state of the network.
