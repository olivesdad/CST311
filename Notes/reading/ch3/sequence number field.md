## sequence number
- *The sequence number for a segment is therefore the byte-stream
number of the first byte in the segment
- This means that if a segment has bytes 1000-2000 the sequence number would be 1000 and the previous segment 0-1000 would have a sequence number of 0

**seq is what youre sending**
