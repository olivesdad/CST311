# Network Layer
- Network layer takes data from the transport layer and encapsulates each segment into a [[datagram]]
- This layer includes routers and stuff

## WOrds
- **Routing**  refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination
- **Forwarding** Directing a packet from the router input to proper output link
- [[forwarding table]] This is like it sounds. Some table that the router stores that helps it detrmine which link it should forward packets to
- [[control plane]]  It is thr routing algorithm which may be implimented at the router level or at a controller which sets the routing tables in the routers (this is the heart of [[SDN]].)

### Network service model
THis determines how the network behaves and what services it provides. Some services could include:
- **Guaranteed delivery** Guarantee packets will eventually arrive
- **Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay** Guarantees delivery of packet within some time like maybe within 100ms
- **In-order packet delivery**
- **Guaranteed minimal bandwidth** As long as the sending host transmits bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then all packets are eventually delivered to the destination host.
- **Security** the network layer could encrypt all datagrams at the source and decrypt them at the destination
>[!best-effort service]
>This is the onlything the internet's network layer provides a single service basically this means that there is no guarantee end to end delay bandwidth or service
