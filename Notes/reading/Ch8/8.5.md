# SECURING E-MAIL
Security is applied at all layers of the network stack. It is applied in different ways at each layer to protect against different issues
- *Pretty GOod Privacy (PGP)* Is a classic example of an application level security which provides secure email. This was one of the first secuiryt technologies to be broadly used in the internet
### Secure email
==PRIORITIES==
1. Confidentiality
	- We don't want anyone else able to read emails
	- Use public private key to encrypt a session symmetric key to use to enctrypt transactions for this session
2. Authentication
	- We don't want people to send emails pretending to be someone else
	- something about signing a leter with a hash function and private key idk
	- blabla *Digital signature*
3. Integrity
	- Assurance that the mesage is not modified 
	- something about signing a leter with a hash function and private key idk
4. Reciever authentication
	- Make sure that we send the email to the right place
### PGP again
Creates a pair of keys and the public can be  sent out to everyone while the private key is password protected.
