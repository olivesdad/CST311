# SECURING TCP CONNECTION: SSL
TCP security services sinclude confidentiallity, data integrity, and end-ppoint authentication.
## SSL
Secure Socket Layer
- Originally designed by Netscape 
- Used by almost all E-commercie sites for credit card numebrs and stuff
- Often used for transactions that take place eover HTTP but has other applications with basically anything involving TCP
- Technically this resides in the application layer but from the developer's perspective it is a transport protocol that provides the enhanced TCP security![[Pasted image 20220522005421.png]]
==3 Phases==
1. Haandshake 
	- Establish TCP connection
	- Verify Sender
		- Sender sends certificate that has been certified by a [[CA]]
	- SEnd master key
		- *Master Secret (MS)*
		- Will only be used for this SSL session
		- Encrypts the MS to make an *(EMS)*
		- send EMS 
2. Key  derivation
	- Both parties use the MS to generate 4 keys
		- *Ea* Session Encryption key for data a->b
		- *Ma* Session MAC key for data a->b
		- *Eb* Session Encryption keey for data b->a
		- *Mb* Session MAC key for data b->a
	- These keys are used for encrypting and decrypting techinal details seem unimportant at this time
1. Data  transfer
	- MAC Is hardware identifier 
	- TCP breaks data steam into "records" and adds the MAC thing to the end of each one
	- encrypts the record with the MAC key
