# End-Point Authentication
*End-Point authentication* is the process of one entity proving its identity to another entity over a computer network
#### Authentication Protocol ap1.0
Basically nothing at all. In this scenario the sender just sends a message stating who they are and the reciever believs them *Hi I am Andy ;)*
#### Authentication Protocol ap2.0
Reciever attempts to veriify sender by the source address of the IP datagram garrying the authentication message which matches the senders *"Well known"* address.
In this case someone would just have to put a differnt IP in the datagram to impersonate this is known as *IP spoofing*
#### Authentication Protocol ap3.0
Password authentication obvious security issue is someone getting the password. If someone wanted to sniff the packets they would be able to read you password
#### Authentication Procol ap3.1
To protect password we encrypt it. This is still vulnerable  to sniffing because if someone were to record the encrypted password they could still send it to the server to gain access known as a *playback attack*
#### Authentication Protocol ap4.0
- **Nonce**: is a number that the protocol will use only once in a lifetime. That is, once a protcol uses a nonce, it will never use that number again.
After user authenticates the server sends a nonce which the user encrypts with the symmetric key that only the sender and reciever have and sends it back. If the reciever decrypts it then they know the sender is who they say they are
